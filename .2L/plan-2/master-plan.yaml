strategy: |
  Two-iteration UI/UX redesign approach balancing risk mitigation with efficiency.

  Master exploration revealed MEDIUM complexity with a critical finding: the landing
  page is already professionally redesigned (plan-1 delivered modern gradients, hero
  section, features showcase). This significantly reduces scope.

  Primary work focuses on ADMIN and STUDENT sections, which still use minimal styling.

  Strategy rationale:
  - Iteration 1 establishes design system foundation and tackles highest-risk area (admin
    dashboard with authentication flows) while allowing production validation before
    touching student-facing pages
  - Iteration 2 polishes student experience and completes comprehensive testing
  - Design system (Feature 4) is foundational dependency for all other features
  - Admin section (Feature 2) has highest surface area and medium-high risk
  - Student section (Feature 3) is simpler but requires RTL/mobile perfection

  Risk management:
  - Separating admin and student flows allows validation checkpoints
  - Performance budgets established: CSS <100KB, no new JS dependencies
  - RTL and responsive testing critical in both iterations

  Explorer consensus: 2 iterations optimal for risk/efficiency balance.

    name: "Design System & Admin Dashboard Redesign"
    vision: "Establish unified design system and modernize admin dashboard with professional styling, enhanced forms, and polished authentication flows"
    scope: |
      **Features Implemented:**
      - Feature 4: Unified Design System (FOUNDATION - blocks all others)
        - Update globals.css with enhanced CSS variables (blue/indigo palette)
        - Define typography scale (heading hierarchy, body text)
        - Create gradient utilities and shadow system
        - Document spacing standards and reusable patterns

      - Feature 5: Professional Navigation & Branding
        - Create professional logo component (BarChart3 icon + gradient wordmark)
        - Implement sticky navigation with backdrop blur
        - Ensure consistent header across admin section
        - Add professional favicon

      - Feature 2: Enhanced Admin Dashboard UI (HIGHEST COMPLEXITY)
        - Modernize admin login page (/app/(auth)/admin/page.tsx)
          * Gradient branding header
          * Professional form styling with validation feedback
          * Loading states with spinners
        - Redesign admin dashboard shell (/app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx)
          * Improved header with gradient and user info
          * Enhanced project cards/table with shadows and hover effects
          * Better empty states with encouraging CTAs
        - Polish project management components
          * CreateProjectDialog with enhanced modal styling
          * UpdatePasswordDialog with backdrop blur
          * DeleteProjectDialog with professional warnings
          * Form inputs with better styling (react-hook-form + shadcn/ui)
          * Professional button styles with gradients

      **Work Estimate:** 6-8 hours

      **Risk Level:** MEDIUM-HIGH
      - Authentication flows are critical (admin login must not break)
      - Form validation UX must remain smooth
      - RTL layout must work for Hebrew admin UI

      **Success Criteria:**
      - Design tokens established and documented in globals.css
      - Admin login page looks professional with gradients and modern styling
      - Admin dashboard has polished cards, tables, and CTAs
      - All forms have enhanced styling with clear validation feedback
      - Modals use backdrop blur and professional styling
      - Zero functional regression (all admin workflows work identically)
      - RTL layout works correctly throughout admin section
      - Mobile-responsive admin UI (tablet/desktop focused, mobile acceptable)

      **Critical Testing:**
      - Admin login with correct/incorrect credentials
      - Create, update, delete project workflows
      - Form validation error states
      - Modal interactions
      - Responsive design on tablet/desktop
      - RTL layout verification
