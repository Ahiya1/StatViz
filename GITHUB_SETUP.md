# GitHub Setup for StatViz

StatViz has been initialized as a standalone Git repository, separate from the 2L platform.

## Quick Setup

### 1. Create New GitHub Repository

Go to: https://github.com/new

Settings:
- **Repository name**: `StatViz` (or `statviz`)
- **Description**: `Statistical Visualization Platform - Secure student research project sharing`
- **Visibility**: Public or Private (your choice)
- **DO NOT initialize** with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

### 2. Push to GitHub

After creating the repo, GitHub will show you instructions. Use these commands:

```bash
# Add the remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/StatViz.git

# Or if using HTTPS:
# git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/StatViz.git

# Push the code
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Verify

Your StatViz repo should now be live at:
`https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/StatViz`

## Repository Structure

- **Main branch**: `main`
- **Commits**: 1 initial commit with full codebase
- **Size**: 182 files, ~64k lines of code
- **History**: Includes `.2L/` folder with complete build documentation

## Next Steps

After pushing to GitHub:

1. **Deploy to Vercel**: Follow instructions in `DEPLOYMENT.md`
2. **Update README**: Customize `README.md` with your deployment URL
3. **Set Repository Description**: Add topics like `nextjs`, `prisma`, `education`, `hebrew`

## Already Configured

✅ `.gitignore` - Excludes node_modules, .env, uploads, etc.
✅ `vercel.json` - Deployment configuration
✅ `.vercelignore` - Vercel-specific exclusions
✅ Git initialized with main branch
✅ Initial commit with full project

## Relationship with 2L

The 2L platform repository (`Ahiya1/2L`) now excludes the `Prod/` folder. Each project generated by 2L should be managed as a separate repository.

**2L Repo**: Platform code only
**StatViz Repo**: This standalone project

This separation allows:
- Independent version control for each project
- Cleaner deployment workflows
- Easier collaboration on individual projects
- 2L platform updates don't affect deployed projects
